 <!-- positions  -->
  <!-- 1.static ( by default)
  2.realative: we can set  position from top left right bottom |we  we can 
  set its position anywhere in the page but it will not leave (space) its fist 
  postion means the the content of bottom  of it  will not come up 
  "RELATIVE ONLY CHANGES ITS POSITION NOT SHIFTS"
  3.fixed: postion  fix on the screen 
  4.sticky : eg : h4's pos is sticky and top =0; it means when it 
  reaches at 0 px from top it will be fixed  -->
  <!-- 5.absolute  "ABSOLUTE leaves (shifts) ITS POSITION.
 we can move it accordingly and if we defines its position
 from top r l bot.. then moves itself respect to its ancestor 
 IFF ancestor's pos is defined else fixes its position acc to screen " -->


 <!-- Z index val=0(by default): z index moves position in z direction
   means if an element is top of an 2nd elemenet but we want to see 2nd elem at top 
   then we will set its z index value greater than first elem  -->
